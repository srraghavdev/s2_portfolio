                                            SwachhDNR is a popular mobile inspection and auditing
                                            software developed by Sarva Suvidhaen Pvt. Ltd. It is
                                            designed to solve several common problems related to
                                            workplace safety, compliance, and operational
                                            efficiency. Some of the problems that SwachhDNR helps
                                            address include:
                                        </p>

                                            <strong>Processes:</strong> Many organizations still
                                            rely on paper forms for inspections and audits, which
                                            can be time-consuming, prone to errors, and difficult to
                                            manage. SwachhDNR replaces paper-based processes with
                                            digital forms and checklists, making data collection and
                                            analysis more efficient.
                                        </p>

                                            <strong>Compliance Management:</strong> Ensuring
                                            compliance with safety regulations, industry standards,
                                            and internal policies can be challenging. SwachhDNR
                                            helps organizations create and manage custom checklists
                                            and templates that align with regulatory requirements,
                                            simplifying compliance management.

                                            <strong>Data Accuracy:</strong> Manual data entry can
                                            introduce errors into inspection and audit reports.
                                            SwachhDNR eliminates the need for manual data entry by
                                            capturing information electronically, reducing the risk
                                            of inaccuracies.

                                            inspection results and collaborating on corrective
                                            actions can be challenging. SwachhDNR allows for

                                            "Outcome-Driven Innovation" (ODI) is a strategy and
                                            innovation framework developed by Anthony W. Ulwick, a
                                            pioneer in the field of innovation management. It
                                            focuses on identifying and delivering the outcomes that
                                            customers are trying to achieve rather than simply
                                            improving existing products or services. While Sarva

                                            be inferred that some of their approaches align with
                                            this framework in the context of workplace safety and
                                            compliance solutions:

                                            <strong>Jobs to Be Done:</strong> ODI relies on the

                                            "hire" products or services to help them accomplish
                                            specific tasks or achieve certain outcomes. Sarva
